In this post, I will talk about Probability theory and random variables.

In this topic, one common concept is the visualization of different probability distributions, which are fundamental in understanding random variables. Here's an example where I visualized a Normal (Gaussian) distribution, which is a cornerstone in probability theory and often used in machine learning:

-   **Generating Random Data**: Using **`numpy`** to generate random data following a normal distribution.

-   **Visualization**: Using **`matplotlib`** to plot the histogram of this data to visualize the distribution.

Here's the Python code to do this:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate random data from a normal distribution
mu, sigma = 0, 0.1  # mean and standard deviation
s = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)

# Create the histogram of the data
count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 30, density=True)

# Plot the distribution curve
plt.plot(bins, 1/(sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) *
               np.exp(- (bins - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2)),
         linewidth=2, color='r')
plt.title('Normal Distribution (Gaussian)')
plt.xlabel('Value')
plt.ylabel('Probability Density')
plt.show()
```

Running this code gives us a graphical representation of a normal distribution, which is an essential concept in probability theory related to random variables. We can modify **`mu`** and **`sigma`** to see how the distribution changes. This kind of visualization is particularly useful in understanding data distributions in machine learning.
