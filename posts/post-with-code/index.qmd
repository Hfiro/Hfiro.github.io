This post is about clustering in ML!

![](second%20post.png){width="366"}

Clustering is a crucial technique in machine learning, particularly in unsupervised learning. A common method for clustering is the K-Means algorithm. We can visualize clustering by using Python with libraries such as **`matplotlib`** for plotting and **`sklearn`** for machine learning functionalities.

Here's an example of a Python script that generates random data, applies the K-Means clustering algorithm, and visualizes the results:

-   **Generate Random Data**: Creating a dataset with random points.

-   **Apply K-Means Clustering**: Using the K-Means algorithm to identify clusters in the data.

-   **Visualization**: Plotting the data points and color them according to their cluster.

Here's the Python code:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

# Generate random data
n_samples = 300
n_features = 2
centers = 4
X, y_true = make_blobs(n_samples=n_samples, n_features=n_features, centers=centers)

# Apply K-Means Clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=centers)
kmeans.fit(X)
y_kmeans = kmeans.predict(X)

# Visualization
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y_kmeans, s=50, cmap='viridis')
centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_
plt.scatter(centers[:, 0], centers[:, 1], c='black', s=200, alpha=0.5)
plt.title('K-Means Clustering')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.show()
```

Running this code will give usa visual representation of the clustered data points, showing how K-Means algorithm groups the data into distinct clusters. This is a simple yet effective way to understand the concept of clustering in machine learning.
